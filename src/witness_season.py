"""A SEASON-INTEGRATED witness for the season-integrated part of the yield term.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `check_yield.py` tests two per-farm claims. The completion term is
tested well: it makes a same-day claim and there is a same-day witness, and that test
already caught a sign error. The accumulation term is tested BADLY, and the mismatch is
structural rather than a matter of effort:

    season_integral  is an integral over 12 Jun - 13 Oct
    s2_ndvi_20251013 is one instant, 13 Oct
    s1_vh_db         is one instant, 10 Oct

Correlating a season integral against a single instant is the wrong comparison. It is
why test 2 reads "mixed, and honestly so": for a crop already harvested by October both
witnesses are looking at bare soil, so they cannot speak about what accumulated in July.

WHY NOT INTEGRATED OPTICAL. The obvious fix is cumulative NDVI -- the standard yield
proxy through the Monteith chain (yield ~ integral of APAR, NDVI ~ fAPAR). It is
impossible here, and `why_xband.py` already measured why: over Sokhda in 2025 the count
of Sentinel-2 scenes under 20% cloud is **0 in June, 0 in July, 0 in August, 0 in
September** -- the best July scene is 92.6% cloud. The entire accumulation period has no
optical record. There is nothing to integrate.

WHAT THIS DOES INSTEAD. Sentinel-1 C-band is cloud-immune, so it observed the season
that Sentinel-2 missed: **10 RTC scenes, 12 Jun to 10 Oct**. Every one is relative orbit
34, descending -- one geometry all season, so the integral is not contaminated by a
changing incidence angle. Cross-pol VH is the volume-scattering channel and the
conventional C-band biomass proxy.

The integral is formed EXACTLY as the model forms its own -- trapezoid over day-of-year
in LINEAR power, matching `farm_stats.py` -- so the comparison is like-for-like and not
an artefact of two different definitions of "integral".

INDEPENDENCE. Sentinel-1 is a different satellite, a different frequency (5.405 vs
9.65 GHz), a different polarisation (cross vs co) and a different geometry. It never
enters the model, and this file writes nothing that `d4_submission.py` reads. It is a
witness, exactly like the two already in `witness.csv`.

This test can REFUTE the accumulation term. That is the point of running it.

Run:  python src/witness_season.py      (writes results/witness_season.csv)
