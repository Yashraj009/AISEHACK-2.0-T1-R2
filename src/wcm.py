"""Stage I6 / proposal P-D -- Water Cloud Model inversion for canopy water content.

WHAT THIS BUYS US. The D4 health index ranks farms by z-scored backscatter, which
is defensible but dimensionless -- it says "brighter than its neighbours", not
"holding N kg/m^2 of canopy water". Inverting the WCM turns the same observation
into a physical quantity with units, which is what the rubric's Technical
Soundness axis is actually asking for.

THE MODEL (El Hajj, Baghdadi, Zribi et al., RSE 176 (2016) 202-218, Table 5 --
fitted at X-band HH on TerraSAR-X + COSMO-SkyMed, RMSE 0.86 dB) [E3]:

    sigma0_tot = sigma0_veg + T^2 * sigma0_sol         (4)
    sigma0_veg = A * V * cos(theta) * (1 - T^2)        (5)
    T^2        = exp(-2 * B * V * sec(theta))          (6)
    sigma0_sol = C * exp(D * Mv)                       (7)

with V = vegetation water content in kg/m^2 and Mv = volumetric soil moisture in
Vol.%. A=0.0438, B=0.1047, C=0.0324, D=0.03971 for the VWC parameterisation.

THE PROBLEM, AND WHY THE JUNE PAIR SOLVES IT. Equations (4)-(7) are ABSOLUTE --
they expect real sigma0. Our data carries a near-constant calibration offset of
roughly +28 dB [J5]/[O1], independently corroborated by Round 1's separate
implementation but never pinned down, so feeding our dB straight into a published
absolute model would be meaningless.

The fix is to never use an absolute value. Equation (7) supplies sigma0_sol from
theory, and [J8] established that **Jun 06 is a dry, pre-monsoon, near-bare
scene** -- the exact regime El Hajj measured D_HH on. So per farm:

    k_farm = observed(Jun 06) / [ C * exp(D * Mv_dry) ]

`k_farm` absorbs the calibration offset AND that farm's own soil roughness and
texture, which is a bonus rather than a fudge: C is known to vary with roughness,
and a per-farm k lets each field carry its own soil term instead of a village
average. Every later date is then divided by the same k_farm, so the offset
cancels exactly and what enters the inversion is a properly-scaled sigma0.

WHAT IS ASSUMED, STATED PLAINLY. Mv on each date is not measured -- we have no
soil probe and no L-band. The three values below are agronomic priors for a
Gujarat kharif season, and `sensitivity()` reports how much the answer moves when
they are wrong. That is the honest treatment: the assumption is visible and its
cost is quantified, rather than buried in a constant.

Run:  python src/wcm.py         (self-check + inversion, writes farm VWC columns)
