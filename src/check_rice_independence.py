"""Leave-channel-out test for the rice channel -- replacing a circular check.

The claim previously made was: "61% of flood-detected farms come back labelled
Rice against a 9% base rate -- 6.8x enrichment". That is a tautology. `flood_hit`
carries weight 2.2 in e["Rice"], the largest weight anywhere in the evidence
function, so farms are labelled Rice BECAUSE they flood. The check cannot fail.

A test that CAN fail: strip the flood channel out of the evidence entirely,
re-assign crops on what remains, and ask whether the flood-detected farms still
come back Rice on the strength of the other evidence alone.

  - If they do, the remaining channels independently corroborate the rice call.
  - If they do not, rice rests on a single channel. That is worth knowing and
    worth reporting; it is not a reason to hide the test.

Second, genuinely external test: rice paddies are hydrologically distinctive, so
we check the rice labels against a wetness signal that never enters the model at
all (Sentinel-1 C-VH, a different sensor and frequency).
