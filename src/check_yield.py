"""Validate the yield deliverable -- the one output with no external reference.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The health index has two independent witnesses. Yield had none, and
the obvious check is worthless: comparing our village aggregate against the district
APY figure just returns the season-completion constant, because the APY figure is an
INPUT. That comparison confirms arithmetic, not agronomy.

WHAT CAN ACTUALLY BE TESTED. Yield = district anchor x completion(farm) x
accumulation(farm). The anchor is an input and is untestable here. The two per-farm
terms are ours, and they make falsifiable claims about the world:

  completion(farm)   claims to measure how far through its cycle a field is on 13 Oct
  accumulation(farm) claims to measure how much canopy was carried across the season

Both are checkable against sensors that never enter the model.

THIS TEST HAS ALREADY EARNED ITS KEEP. On first run it showed the completion term was
INVERTED: d_oct_aug correlates POSITIVELY with same-day NDVI in all five crops, so a
field that brightened between August and October has MORE standing biomass, not less.
The term was reading standing crop as senescence and the sign was flipped. No internal
consistency check would have caught it -- only a sensor that disagrees can.

Run:  python src/check_yield.py
