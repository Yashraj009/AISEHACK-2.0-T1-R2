"""Stage D4 -- crop type, health index, yield-to-date, and submission.csv.

This is the SUBMITTABLE GATE. Everything after it is improvement on something
already valid; nothing downstream starts until this writes 966 clean rows.

Three steps, each with the constraint that forced its design:

1. CROP  -- soft evidence -> per-farm probabilities -> prior-matched -> argmax.
   Forced by [J3]: in Round 1 a HARD per-pixel crop assignment from SAR scored
   MSE 19354 against 12911 for a flat prior -- 5x WORSE than assigning nothing.
   Single-pol X-band HH genuinely cannot separate five crops confidently, so the
   model must emit probabilities and the class marginals must be pinned to a
   prior rather than inferred freely. We still argmax at the very end because the
   CSV schema demands one crop_type per farm, but the probabilities survive in
   crop_confidence and in the debug table.

2. HEALTH -- crop-relative composite of the feature families that survived QA.
   Scored WITHIN crop, because a healthy groundnut and a healthy cotton have
   completely different backscatter. Excludes ktex [H2] and subcoh [I1], both
   documented negatives.

3. YIELD  -- district yield anchor x relative performance x season completion.
   "to date" is taken literally: on Oct 13 cotton is barely into picking while
   rice is essentially harvested, so the same health score means very different
   accumulated yield.

    `yield_estimate_to_date` values of 1.24-9.00, and their sample writeup says
    "estimated yield (tonnes/hectare)". The column is therefore t/ha, NOT the
    kg/ha of the APY district source, so the conversion happens here -- once, at
    the single point where the deliverable's unit is decided.

    The district figure is the only yield anchor that exists for this area [O5];
    it sets the LEVEL. SAR cannot measure absolute yield without calibration data,
    so what it contributes is the two RELATIVE terms. Level from statistics,
    variation from SAR -- stated as the split rather than blurred.

    WHY TWO MEASURED TERMS AND NOT A CONSTANT. Previously both completion and the
    relative term were per-crop constants driven by the health percentile, which
    made yield an exact monotone image of health: within every crop
    Spearman(health, yield) came back 1.000, so the column carried no information
    beyond crop_type and health_index. Two deliverables, one number. Now:

      completion(farm)  -- measured, not assumed. The question "how far through its
        cycle is this field on 13 Oct" is answered by d_oct_aug: a field that has
        senesced or been harvested has brightened back toward bare soil (village
        median +2.38 dB), one still carrying canopy has not. The crop's nominal
        completion sets the centre, the farm's own senescence moves it within a
        band. A late-sown cotton plot still in full canopy now correctly reads as
        LESS complete than its harvested neighbour.
      accumulation(farm) -- the season integral, i.e. the accumulated growth curve.
        This is the published approach (accumulate over the season, compare against
