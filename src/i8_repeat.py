"""Stage I8 -- repeat-pass interferometric coherence, Jun19 vs Aug14. [O2]

WHY ATTEMPT IT AT ALL. The rubric names temporal coherence as a scorable SAR
physics axis, and coherence is the one product that uses the SLC phase across
acquisitions rather than within one (which is what [I1]/sublook.py already did).
If it worked it would be the single most discriminating crop-dynamics layer we
could build from this data.

WHY IT IS EXPECTED TO FAIL, stated before running so the result cannot be
retrofitted. Three independent reasons, any one of which is fatal:
  1. 56-day baseline at X-band (3.1 cm) over a growing canopy. Temporal
     decorrelation over vegetation is near-total in days, not months [B4].
  2. No orbit state vectors are distributed with these products, so the
     perpendicular baseline is unknown and the flat-earth / topographic fringe
     cannot be removed analytically. We estimate and remove the dominant fringe
     empirically instead, which is weaker.
  3. Range pixel spacing differs between the two scenes (1.2825 vs 1.2855 m),
     i.e. ~0.23%, which is several pixels of drift across the AOI. Handled by
     estimating the offset per block rather than globally.

WHY THE ANSWER IS TRUSTWORTHY EITHER WAY -- the three controls. A bare "coherence
was low" claim is worthless, because a coregistration bug produces exactly the
same number as real decorrelation. So every run reports:

  SELF    Jun19 correlated with ITSELF through the identical code path.
          Must return ~1.0. If it does not, the estimator is broken and no
          other number in this file means anything.
  NULL    Jun19 vs Aug14 deliberately mis-registered by 200 px, i.e. two
          genuinely unrelated pieces of ground. This is the EMPIRICAL bias
          floor of a finite boxcar -- |gamma_hat| is biased high, and this
          measures that bias directly instead of trusting a formula.
  STABLE  coherence on persistent bright scatterers (buildings, roads, the
          canal) versus on farm fields, both from the real coregistered pair.
          This is the check that separates the two failure modes:
            stable > null  ->  coregistration WORKED, so low field coherence is
                               real temporal decorrelation. Reportable negative.
            stable ~ null  ->  we failed to coregister. Uninformative, and must
                               be reported as uninformative, not as a finding.
