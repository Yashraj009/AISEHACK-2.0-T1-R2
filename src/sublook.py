"""Stage I2b -- sub-look (zero temporal baseline) coherence. [D1]

Why this exists. The rubric names "temporal coherence" as a scorable SAR physics
axis, but our shortest repeat-pass baseline is 56 days at X-band, where the
literature expects near-total decorrelation over growing crops [B4]. Rather than
report only that failure, we exploit the fact that the SLC is COMPLEX: a single
acquisition can be split along its azimuth Doppler spectrum into two sub-apertures,
which view the scene from slightly different squint angles at the SAME instant.

Correlating those two sub-looks gives a coherence with ZERO temporal baseline, so
it cannot decorrelate through time at all. What it measures instead is angular /
structural stability:

    high sub-look coherence -> a few dominant, deterministic scatterers
                               (bare soil, harvested stubble, built-up, roads)
    low  sub-look coherence -> many randomly-placed scatterers whose interference
                               changes with viewing angle, i.e. a VOLUME -- a canopy

So it reads as a canopy-structure indicator, available on all four dates, and it
uses the phase that every amplitude-only approach discards [C3-T5].

Method per date:
  1. FFT along azimuth (axis 0 -- rows are azimuth, delta_line_time per row)
  2. find the occupied Doppler band from the mean power spectrum
  3. take the lower and upper half of that band as two sub-looks
  4. demodulate each to baseband, so the sub-look centre-frequency offset does not
     appear as a phase ramp across the estimation window
  5. IFFT, then boxcar coherence  |<s1 s2*>| / sqrt(<|s1|^2><|s2|^2>)
  6. geocode with the same GCPs as I1 and average per farm
